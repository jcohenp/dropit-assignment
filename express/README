I copied the server folder from the express-mongo-rest-api-example
here you will fine the conf.env file
the dockerfile is the file that I used for building the image

TESTING:
clone the express-mongo-rest-api-example git repository 
add the Dockerfile in the root of the git repository 
replace the server folder by my server folder
